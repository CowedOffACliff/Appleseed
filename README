Appleseed - Plant trees that drop apples on the ground (or other items!):
Version: v0.3.1

There are other plugins out there that make trees drop apples/items when you break the leaves, but this 
plugin doesn't do that. With Appleseed, all existing trees are left as-is. To get an apple tree, you 
must use a hoe to create soil, then right click the soil with an apple in hand. Done correctly(and if 
you have permission), a sapling will appear in the soil. When the sapling grows(use bonemeal to speed 
this up), the tree will drop apples on the ground. 

Features:
 - Plant items in soil(aka farmland) and grow a tree that drops that item on the ground
 - Config file that controls allowed types of trees, item drop interval and likelihood
 - Permissions to control who can plant trees(and what type)

TODO:
 - Bonus items with very low likelihood
 - Optional tree death after some number of fertilizer cycles
 - Configurable "seed" item
